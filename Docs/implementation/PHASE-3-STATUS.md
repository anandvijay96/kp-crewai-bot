    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize agent registry
        self.agents = {
            'blog_researcher': EnhancedBlogResearcherAgent(),
            'comment_writer': CommentWriterAgent()
        }
        
        # Campaign management state
        self.active_campaigns = {}
        self.task_queue = []
        self.performance_metrics = {}
    
    # Core Methods Implementation
    def create_campaign() -> Dict[str, Any]
    async def execute_campaign() -> Dict[str, Any]
    def _generate_campaign_tasks() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
    async def _execute_campaign_tasks() -> Dict[str, Any]
    async def _execute_single_task() -> Dict[str, Any]
    async def _validate_campaign_quality() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### Task Dependency Management
```python
# Sophisticated Dependency Resolution:
campaign_tasks = [
    {
        'type': 'blog_research',
        'dependencies': [],  # Root task
        'priority': 1
    },
    {
        'type': 'content_analysis', 
        'dependencies': [blog_research_task_id],
        'priority': 2
    },
    {
        'type': 'comment_generation',
        'dependencies': [content_analysis_task_id],
        'priority': 3
    },
    {
        'type': 'quality_validation',
        'dependencies': [comment_generation_task_ids],
        'priority': 4
    }
]
```

### Quality Assurance Framework
```python
# Multi-Factor Quality Validation:
quality_metrics = {
    'total_comments': len(comment_results),
    'valid_comments': len(high_quality_comments),
    'quality_pass_rate': valid_comments / total_comments,
    'average_quality_score': mean(quality_scores),
    'meets_threshold': quality_pass_rate >= threshold,
    'quality_breakdown': {
        'high_quality': count_high_quality,
        'medium_quality': count_medium_quality,
        'low_quality': count_low_quality
    }
}
```
