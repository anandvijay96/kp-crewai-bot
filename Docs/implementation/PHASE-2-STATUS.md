    """
    
    # Tools Integration
    - web_scraper: WebScraper()
    - content_analyzer: ContentAnalysisTool() 
    - seo_analyzer: SEOAnalyzer()
    - blog_validator: BlogValidatorTool()
    
    # Key Methods
    - discover_blogs(): Multi-source blog discovery
    - validate_blogs(): Comprehensive blog validation
    - generate_research_report(): Detailed analysis and recommendations
    - execute_research_campaign(): Complete automated workflow
```

### Search and Discovery Strategy
```python
# Multi-source blog discovery:
search_templates = {
    'blog_discovery': [
        '"{keyword}" blog comments',
        '"{keyword}" + "leave a comment"', 
        '"{keyword}" + "post a comment"',
        '"{keyword}" inurl:blog',
        'site:wordpress.com "{keyword}"',
        'site:medium.com "{keyword}"'
    ],
    'authority_blogs': [
        '"{keyword}" site:edu',
        '"{keyword}" site:gov', 
        '"{keyword}" high authority blog'
    ],
    'niche_specific': [
        '"{keyword}" guest post',
        '"{keyword}" write for us',
        '"{keyword}" contribute'
    ]
}
```

### Quality Assessment Framework
```python
# Multi-factor blog scoring:
quality_thresholds = {
    'minimum_authority_score': 50,
    'minimum_quality_score': 60,
    'minimum_comment_opportunity': 40,
    'maximum_spam_risk': 30,
    'minimum_overall_score': 60
}

# Weighted scoring system:
weights = {
    'authority': 0.25,      # Domain authority and credibility
    'quality': 0.25,        # Content quality and structure  
    'comments': 0.30,       # Comment system and opportunities
    'technical': 0.10,      # Technical factors (HTTPS, mobile, etc.)
    'spam_safety': 0.10     # Spam risk and safety assessment
}
```
