# Phase 5: Backend Integration - CrewAI KP Bot

## Objective
The main goal of this phase is to establish seamless communication between the CrewAI KP Bot's frontend and backend systems. This includes developing and integrating robust REST/GraphQL APIs to connect the existing frontend with the backend's AI-powered agents, enabling real-time data communication.

## Key Tasks
1. **API Layer Development:**
   - Implement REST/GraphQL endpoints for all existing AI agents.
   - Develop a comprehensive authentication and authorization system.
   - Ensure API documentation and testing.
   - Establish rate limiting and other security measures.

2. **Real-time Data Integration:**
   - Connect the frontend's TanStack Query to backend API endpoints.
   - Implement WebSocket integration for live updates and real-time notifications.
   - Develop error handling and user feedback systems.

3. **Database API Integration:**
   - Design and implement CRUD operations via secure API endpoints.
   - Optimize database connection pooling and performance.
   - Implement data validation, sanitization, and transaction management.
